## 1. Implementation

- [x] 1.1 Add query form state for knowledgeBaseId, queryText, minScore (0.7), and limit (5) with a manual search
  trigger.
- [x] 1.2 Add API client/types for chunk search results and render the results table with score sorting and
  expand/collapse behavior.
- [x] 1.3 Move the current knowledge base management list into a header-button entry (modal or panel) while preserving
  create/edit/delete/enable/disable flows.
- [x] 1.4 Update styles to support the query-first layout and result expansion UI.
- [ ] 1.5 Validate via UI smoke check or frontend tests if available.
